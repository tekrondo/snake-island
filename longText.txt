A company boilerplate is a few paragraphs of text about the company that 
goes at the bottom of all its press releases.
This text describes the company, its purpose, and often, its size, presence, 
and chief locations.
The boilerplate text is standardized, i.e. it is used on every press release with 
little to no change.
You might make a few minor tweaks for different releases, but the overall text 
remains largely the same.
If a company changes its boilerplate copy, it’s usually just to update some facts.
Although often overlooked, the company boilerplate is an important part of any PR 
campaign.
In the next section, I’ll discuss the importance of the boilerplate.
What is the Purpose of the Company Boilerplate?
As this Fractl survey revealed, 57% of journalists receive between 50 and 500 pitches 
each week.
Another survey found that journalists spend less than one minute reading press releases – 
and that’s for releases they actually opened!
Put yourself in the shoes of a journalist. You’re going through dozens of press releases 
every day.
They all seem to sound similar and come from companies you can neither recognize nor 
remember.
You wonder: Did I write about this company earlier? Or was it another similarly 
named company?
This is where company boilerplates help. 
By standardizing the ‘about’ text, you add much-needed consistency and clarity 
to your press releases. 
Since the boilerplate remains the same, it cues journalists into your company’s 
description across different releases.
