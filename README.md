#QUEST TO BECOMING A PYTHONISTA

I tried learning the Python programming language some 5 months ago (March 2019) but stopped.
I am commiting to learning the language now even more than ever.

I am first taking the free course from Dr. Chuck at (py4e.com)[https://www.py4e.com/]. I will continue on with other resources as I advance my skillset.

- I would be updating this read me (maybe) with progress or include a READMENext.md to track my progress.
